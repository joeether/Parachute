# Parachute
 A parachute to drop items in game
 To use this, On the prefab of the parachute attach abox of your choice in place of the package(cube) to act as avisual during the decent. The gift item should be the actual item you are wanting to place in your game. I am currently using this with mirror multiplayer, so the gift item and the parachute both need to be added to the registered prefabs list of your network manager. If using in single player game just remove the network identy from the chute prefab and change the code back to monbehavior instaed of networkbehaviour.
